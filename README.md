# üß± Module 8: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python

This module covers the core principles and syntax of **Object-Oriented Programming** in Python. OOP is a programming paradigm that helps in building scalable, maintainable, and modular applications by organizing code into **objects and classes**.

## üß† Topics Covered

### üîπ OOP Fundamentals
- **Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming**
  - What is OOP and why is it useful?
  - Key concepts: class, object, methods, attributes

- **Defining a Class (Part 1 & 2)**
  - Syntax for creating classes
  - Instantiating objects
  - Setting and accessing object attributes
  - Calling methods

- **Constructors and Destructors**
  - `__init__()` method for initialization
  - `__del__()` method for object cleanup

- **Functions vs Object-Oriented Programming**
  - Procedural vs object-oriented approach
  - Advantages of OOP in real-world applications

---

### üß¨ Inheritance & Code Reusability
- **Inheritance**
  - Reusing code from parent classes

  - ‚úÖ **Single-Level Inheritance**
    - One child inherits from one parent

  - ‚úÖ **Multi-Level Inheritance**
    - A child inherits from a parent, which inherits from another parent

  - ‚úÖ **Multiple Inheritance**
    - A child class inherits from multiple parent classes

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced OOP Concepts
- **Operator Overloading**
  - Redefining the behavior of Python operators (`+`, `==`, etc.)
  - Using special methods like `__add__`, `__eq__`

- **Data Hiding (Encapsulation)**
  - Public, protected, and private variables
  - Name mangling (`__var`) for private attributes

## ‚úÖ Key Takeaways

- Object-oriented programming improves **modularity** and **reusability**.
- Python supports all major OOP features: **encapsulation**, **inheritance**, and **polymorphism**.
- Understanding OOP is essential for building scalable applications, especially in **software engineering**, **data analytics**, and **algorithmic trading**.
