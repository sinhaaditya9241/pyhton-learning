# 🧱 Module 7: Object-Oriented Programming in Python (OOP)

This module introduces Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python — a critical step for writing clean, modular, and reusable code, especially useful in larger applications like financial modeling, backtesting engines, and trading bots.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

### 🔹 Basics of OOP
- ✅ **Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming**
  - What is OOP and why it's useful
  - Real-world analogies of objects and classes

- ✅ **Defining a Class (Part 1 & 2)**
  - Syntax for creating classes
  - Attributes and methods
  - Creating instances

- ✅ **Constructors and Destructors**
  - `__init__()` method for object initialization
  - `__del__()` method for cleanup

---

### 🔧 OOP Concepts in Practice

- ✅ **Functions vs OOP**
  - Comparison of procedural vs object-oriented approaches

- ✅ **Inheritance**
  - Sharing and extending functionality

  - 🧬 **Single Level Inheritance**
    - One parent and one child class

  - 🧬 **Multi-Level Inheritance**
    - Class inheritance over multiple generations

  - 🧬 **Multiple Inheritance**
    - A class inheriting from multiple parent classes

- ✅ **Operator Overloading**
  - Customizing behavior of operators like `+`, `==`, etc.

- ✅ **Data Hiding**
  - Public, protected, and private attributes
  - Name mangling and encapsulation
